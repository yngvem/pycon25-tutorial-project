# PyCon 2025 base project

This base project contains the minimal requirements for doing the *Python project packaging: from zero to hero* tutorial at PyCon US 2025.

If you want to use this pre-setup system, then you can fork this repository and start a *codespace*. It will build a container with uv, git and pre-commit installed, which is everything you need for the tutorial.
